 I built a corporate ESG and financial performance analysis using panel data.
The goal was to understand whether ESG acts as a value driver or a risk signal.
I engineered environmental efficiency metrics like carbon intensity, analyzed ESG versus profitability and market capitalization, and studied ESG evolution over time.
The key insight is that high ESG scores alone are not enough — what matters is ESG efficiency and trajectory.
Companies with improving ESG and controlled environmental intensity tend to show better financial resilience.
